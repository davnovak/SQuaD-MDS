**NOTE**: this is a fork of SQuad-MDS with sklearn-like API (`SQuadMDS` class with `.fit_transform`) and easy installation (`pip install .`)

# SQuaD-MDS
implementation of the 'stochastic quartet descent MDS' in python 3

Requirements:
- numba
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy

run 'main.py' for a commented example on how to use the optimiser. 

Four datasets are available in this repository: winequality, airfoil self-noise, RNAseq, and COIL-20. These are descibed in the paper.
